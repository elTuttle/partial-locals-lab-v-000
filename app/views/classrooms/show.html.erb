Classroom Info
<%= render partial: 'classroom', locals: {classroom: @classroom} %>

We now want to call out the oldest student in the class:
<%= render partial: 'students/student', locals: {student: @student} %>

<%@classroom.student.each do |student|%>
  <%binding.pry%>
  <%= render partial: 'students/student', locals: {student: student} %>
<%end%>
